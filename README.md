# 50projects50days-js-course-2023
# This small mini-projects were part of a course from Brad Traversy called 50 projects in 50 days. The projects were quite short but very interesting and useful in practicing with the language 
and learn new techniques. In some projects there are modifications, the Yugidex project is something inspired from the Pokedex that Brad Traversy has on his list as the api link given was not working at the time I was doing this project so I decided to use a completely different API for a different anime.
